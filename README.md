# Advanced TodoList app

## Project description
I build a responsive TodoList webApp that :
1. have a switch theme (light mode and dark mode) 
2. Save all your data in your localStorage (all data saved automatically) 
3. Both laptop and mobile, you can drag and drop your tasks to reorder them depend on their priority
4. add/delete your tasks and filter what you want to see by click "all/active/complete" button
 
## why I called that project advanced...
- because most of TodoList app that you will see have just the 4th feature that i mentioned on the project description ðŸ‘†, and I add top of it the 1t,2d,3rd feature :)
